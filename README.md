# Quantified Self #

Data is transforming our world. Companies across a breadth of industries are gathering information on their operations and using it to make smarter and more efficient decisions. Quantified Self is an application designed to bring the power of data and analytics to the individual.

Quantified Self comes with 4 predetermined meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack). Users can add foods and calorie counts to the application and then log those foods to specific meals. The application runs dynamic calculations on the food diary and displays both your goals and how well you adhered to them. Changes to the diary page alter these figures in real time.
